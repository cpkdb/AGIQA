      # Task
      You are given a text-to-image prompt. Your task is to create MISALIGNMENT by replacing the MAIN SUBJECT with a similar alternative (mild semantic distance - same category, slight variation).

      ## Strategies
      1. Identification: Find the primary subject noun in the prompt
         - Look for: the main animal, person, vehicle, or object that is the focus
         - Example: In "a golden retriever playing in the park", the main subject is "golden retriever"

      2. Replacement Options (mild distance - same category variants):
         - Animals: dog → puppy, hound, different breed; cat → kitten, tabby
         - Vehicles: car → sedan, SUV, coupe; bike → bicycle, cycle
         - People: woman → lady, girl; man → gentleman, guy
         - Objects: cup → mug, glass; chair → armchair, seat
         Example: "golden retriever in park" → "labrador in park"

      3. Preservation Rules:
         - Keep ALL adjectives and modifiers intact
         - Keep the setting/location unchanged
         - Keep actions and poses unchanged
         - Only replace the core noun with same-category variant

      ## Attribute-Specific Constraints
      - Change should be subtle, same general category
      - Viewers might not immediately notice the difference

    moderate: |
      # Task
      You are given a text-to-image prompt. Your task is to create MISALIGNMENT by replacing the MAIN SUBJECT with a related but different alternative (moderate semantic distance - related category, clear difference).

      ## Strategies
      1. Identification: Find the primary subject noun in the prompt
         - Look for: the main animal, person, vehicle, or object that is the focus

      2. Replacement Options (moderate distance - related but different):
         - Animals: dog → cat, fox, wolf; cat → rabbit, hamster; bird → bat
         - Vehicles: car → motorcycle, truck, bus; bicycle → scooter
         - People: woman → man, child, elderly; doctor → nurse, scientist
         - Objects: cup → bowl, bottle; chair → bench, stool
         Example: "golden retriever in park" → "gray cat in park"

      3. Preservation Rules:
         - Keep ALL adjectives (adapt grammar if needed: "a fluffy dog" → "a fluffy cat")
         - Keep the setting/location unchanged
         - Keep actions unchanged (if plausible for new subject)
         - Only replace the core noun

      ## Attribute-Specific Constraints
      - Change should be obvious but still related
      - New subject should still make sense in the context

    severe: |
      # Task
      You are given a text-to-image prompt. Your task is to create MISALIGNMENT by replacing the MAIN SUBJECT with a completely unrelated alternative (severe semantic distance - different category entirely).

      ## Strategies
      1. Identification: Find the primary subject noun in the prompt
         - Look for: the main animal, person, vehicle, or object that is the focus

      2. Replacement Options (severe distance - completely different category):
         - Animals: dog → chair, lamp, tree; cat → bicycle, rock, cloud
         - Vehicles: car → elephant, flower, building; bike → fish, star
         - People: woman → statue, robot, mannequin; child → doll, toy
         - Objects: cup → shoe, book; chair → fish, mountain

         - Keep the setting/location unchanged
         - Keep any applicable modifiers
         - Maintain grammatical correctness
         - Only replace the core noun

      ## Attribute-Specific Constraints

      ## Strategies
      1. Identification: Find secondary objects in the prompt
         - Look for: background elements, props, furniture, environmental objects
         - NOT the main subject
         Example: In "cat sitting on a sofa", secondary object is "sofa"

      2. Replacement Options (mild distance - similar items):
         - Furniture: sofa → couch, armchair; table → desk, counter
         - Settings: forest → woods, grove; beach → shore, coast
         - Props: book → magazine, notebook; cup → mug

         - Keep the main subject completely unchanged
         - Keep the spatial relationship (on, in, near, etc.)
         - Maintain scene plausibility

      ## Attribute-Specific Constraints
