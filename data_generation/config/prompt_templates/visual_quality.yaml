      # Task
      You are given a text-to-image prompt. Your task is to rewrite this prompt so that the resulting image will have visually degraded quality specifically in terms of BLUR/FOCUS (mild level - subtle, barely noticeable). You may apply the following strategies:

      ## Strategies
      1. Global-level: Add subtle blur descriptors to the whole image
         - "slightly soft", "gentle focus", "with subtle haze"
         Example: "a cat on a table" → "a slightly soft cat on a table"

      2. Element-level: Add mild blur to specific subjects
         - "softly focused [subject]", "[object] with gentle blur"
         Example: "portrait of a woman" → "softly focused portrait of a woman"

      3. Replacement-level: Introduce mild blur-causing conditions
         - "with gentle bokeh effect", "through slightly steamy air"
         Example: "coffee shop interior" → "coffee shop interior with gentle bokeh effect"

      ## Attribute-Specific Constraints
      - Focus on FOCUS LOSS, not detail/edge sharpness (that's low_sharpness)
      - Motion blur needs movement context; lens blur needs depth context

    moderate: |
      # Task
      You are given a text-to-image prompt. Your task is to rewrite this prompt so that the resulting image will have visually degraded quality specifically in terms of BLUR/FOCUS (moderate level - clearly noticeable). You may apply the following strategies:

      1. Global-level: Add clear blur descriptors affecting the whole image
         - "out-of-focus", "soft-focus", "noticeably blurry"

      # Task
      You are given a text-to-image prompt. Your task is to rewrite this prompt so that the resulting image will have degraded aesthetic quality specifically in terms of COMPOSITION (mild level - subtle, barely noticeable). You may apply the following strategies:

      ## Strategies
      1. Global-level: Add subtle composition issue descriptors
